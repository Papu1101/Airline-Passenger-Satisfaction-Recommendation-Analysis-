# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Recommendation-Analysis-
This project analyzes airline passenger review data to understand customer satisfaction and recommendation behavior. Using exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, clustering, SQL insights, and Power BI dashboards, the project identifies dissatisfaction patterns and highlights key drivers impacting passenger experience.

📖 Project Overview

Airline companies receive thousands of passenger reviews, but raw feedback alone does not clearly explain why passengers recommend or reject an airline. This project transforms review data into structured insights by analyzing satisfaction patterns, identifying dissatisfaction drivers, and presenting findings through an interactive dashboard.

The analysis follows a logical flow from data exploration to validation and insight communication, ensuring conclusions are data-driven and business-focused.

🎯 Objectives

Understand overall passenger satisfaction levels

Analyze how satisfaction influences recommendation behavior

Identify patterns behind passenger dissatisfaction

Provide clear, actionable insights using structured analysis

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python – Exploratory Data Analysis, hypothesis testing, clustering

SQL (PostgreSQL) – Advanced market-based analytical queries

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and storytelling

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of overall ratings

Comparison across airlines, seat types, and traveler categories

Analysis of verified vs non-verified reviews

Hypothesis Testing

Tested whether overall ratings differ significantly between recommending and non-recommending passengers

Found a strong and statistically significant difference

Cluster Analysis

Grouped passengers based on service rating patterns

Revealed distinct passenger experience segments

SQL-Based Insights

Identified airlines and routes contributing most to dissatisfaction

Ranked airlines by recommendation gaps

Compared traveler segments and verification status

📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard presents:

Overall satisfaction and recommendation overview

Rating distribution and recommendation comparison

Airline-level performance snapshot

The dashboard is designed for non-technical stakeholders and supports data-driven decision-making.

💡 Business Impact

Highlights where passenger dissatisfaction is concentrated

Helps airlines prioritize service improvements

Supports monitoring of customer experience risks

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining Python, SQL, and Power BI can convert unstructured passenger feedback into meaningful insights. The analysis confirms that passenger satisfaction strongly influences recommendation behavior and that dissatisfaction follows identifiable patterns across airlines and segments.
